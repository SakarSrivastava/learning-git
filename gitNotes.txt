# github

- version control system
- suppose you make an app, initially its 1st version
- then you make some changes, then it is second version.
- it manages all the versions and can revert back to previous versions.
- revert changes if there are any issues.

## git branching and merging

- it uses branches to work independently on the current version withou affecting the main code base.
- then you can merge the branch in main code base.
- helps to collaborate, manage the code with other peoples effectively.

- github is web application used to collaborate with other peoples.

- some similar tools are - gitlab, bitbucket etc.
